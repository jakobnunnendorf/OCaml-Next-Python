# OCaml-Next-Python
A collaboration project by Axel Krukziener and Jakob Nunnendorf

## Introduction
To refine and showcase our development skills, we will create a series of OCaml and Python applications, accessible through a NextJS frontend.

### Phase 1: NextJS and JavaScript
In this phase Axel will be implementing algorithms using JavaScript because it is easy to learn. Jakob will assist in integrating Axels code into a website such that it is accessible through the web.
